TOOLS USED: JavaScript, Express Generator, GitHub Repository, Git Bash, Node.js, Pug, SQL ORM Sequelize.

TIPS: IN roder to run thsi app, you will need to first create a repository and download the project files. You will then need to download the DB Browser for SQLite to access the library.DB as the source of data.
